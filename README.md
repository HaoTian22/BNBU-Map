This is a third-party map for Beijing-Normal Hong-Kong University (BNBU), which provides detailed campus maps features. 

It is designed to help students, staff, and visitors easily find their way around the campus using various map services and layers. 

Demo available at: https://u-map.haotian22.top

Features include:
- Interactive campus map with zoom and pan capabilities.
- Search functionality for buildings, facilities, and points of interest.
- Layer control to toggle different map features.
- User real-time location viewing.
- Mobile-friendly design for use on smartphones and tablets.

This repository contains all the necessary files, configuration, scripts, and resources to deploy and customize the BNBU campus map.

The project are powered by TileServer GL, Mapbox GL JS, OSM Liberty Style, Openmaptiles, and OpenStreetMap data.  
(So these are the config files for mutiple differect programs, not a complete program by itself.)
(This means that you need to have these programs installed and configured properly by the config files in this repo in order to run the BNBU campus map.)
